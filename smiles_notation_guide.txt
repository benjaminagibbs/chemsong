SMILES Notation Guide

1. Atoms: 
   - Organic subset (B, C, N, O, P, S, F, Cl, Br, I) are represented by their element symbols.
   - Brackets are used for atoms outside the organic subset or when showing charge/hydrogen count, e.g., [Na], [S+], [H].

2. Bonds: 
   - Single bonds are not shown or represented by '-'.
   - Double bonds are '=', triple bonds are '#', and aromatic bonds are ':'.

3. Branches: 
   - Enclosed in parentheses.
   - Example: Ethanol (C-C-O) is CC(O).

4. Rings: 
   - Atoms in a ring are connected by a number following the atoms in the ring.
   - Example: Benzene (C6H6) is C1=CC=CC=C1.

5. Charges: 
   - Represented by + or - after the element. Multiple charges are shown by repeating the sign, e.g., [N+], [O-], [Fe+++].

6. Stereochemistry: 
   - '@' for anticlockwise and '@@' for clockwise chirality.
   - Example: L-alanine is N[C@@H](C)C(=O)O.

7. Isotopes: 
   - Shown by a number prefix. Example: Deuterium-labeled methane is [2H]C.
