## Overview

Chemsong is an innovative application that visualizes chemical reactions and maps the energies of chemical bonds to musical scales, offering an engaging auditory and visual experience of chemical processes.

## Features

- **Interactive Interface**: The application features a user-friendly layout with real-time input verification, visualization, and audio mapping functionalities.
- **Chemical Reaction Visualization**: Utilizes RDKit for dynamic rendering of molecular structures based on user input.
- **Audio Mapping of Bond Energies**: Converts chemical bond energies into musical notes for an auditory representation of the reaction process.
- **SMILES Notation Guide**: Includes a guide for SMILES notation, assisting users in inputting accurate chemical structures.

## Upcoming Features

- **Object-Oriented Approach**: Future updates will introduce object-oriented programming (OOP) to manage each reaction step, incorporating methods for playing audio, verifying SMILES notation, and rendering images efficiently.
- **Advanced Audio Capabilities**: Enhancement of the audio system to provide more sophisticated and meaningful auditory representations of chemical reactions.
